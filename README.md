# Ballerina Bridge 

Ballerina Bridge allows you to bring in the non-ballerina services into the Ballerina eco-system and leverage ballerina capabilities such as 
distributed transactions, security, observability. The bridge works as a sidecar and the service can reside in the same pod/VM. 
 
## Key Features 
 
 - Ballerina Distributed Transactions. 
 - Security (TLS with JWT Token validation). 
 - Observability (Logging, Tracing and Metrics).



## Usage
- Pull Ballerina Bridge docker image and deploy it alongside your non-Ballerina service. 
- Please refer [getting-started](./samples/getting-started/springboot-helloworld) sample to get started with Ballerina Bridge.  


## Samples 
You can find sample use cases of Ballerina Bridge at [Ballerina Bridge Samples](./samples).
