# Ballerina Bridge 

Ballerina Bridge allows you to bring in the non-ballerina services into the Ballerina eco-system and leverage ballerina capabilities such as 
distributed transactions, security, observability. The bridge works as a sidecar and the service can reside in the same pod/VM. 
 
 ## Key Features 
 
 - Ballerina Distributed Transactions. 
 - Security (TLS with JWT Token validation). 
 - Observability (Logging, Tracing and Metrics).


You can refer [Ballerina Bridge samples](./samples) for more details on the usage.
